# Go-prompt-exercise


## Project Description

This is a comprehensive Go project that demonstrates multiple programming concepts including basic console output, function creation, and mathematical operations. The project now combines functionality from all prompts into a single program that showcases the evolution of the codebase.

**Latest Prompt:** "Create a Go function that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. Provide a clear and concise explanation of the addition logic, either through inline comments within the function or as a brief textual explanation accompanying the code. Supply the complete main.go file, including the function's definition and an example of how to call it and print the result from the main function. Finally, include command-line instructions on how to compile and run the program. Also document this prompt and output in the readme.md file."

**Previous Prompts:**
1. "Create a Go function that prints the string Hello, World! to the console. Include step-by-step comments within the function explaining each part of the code. Provide the complete main.go file with the function defined and called from the main function, along with instructions on how to compile and run the program."
2. "Create an empty Go backend project. The project should consist of a single main.go file that sets up a basic HTTP server. This server should listen on port 8080. Provide the complete main.go file."

## Current Features

The program now demonstrates **all three features** from the previous prompts:

### 1. Hello World Feature (From Second Prompt)
- **Hello World Function**: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console
- **Multiple Print Methods**: Demonstrates `fmt.Println()`, `fmt.Print()`, and `fmt.Printf()`
- **Step-by-Step Comments**: Detailed explanations of each printing method

### 2. Server Feature (From First Prompt)
- **Server Message**: Shows what the HTTP server would display
- **Endpoint Information**: Lists the available endpoints that would exist
- **Port Information**: References the original port 8080 requirement
- **Note**: Server is not actually started, just demonstrates the messages

### 3. Addition Function Feature (From Current Prompt)
- **Addition Function**: Takes two integers and returns their sum
- **Clear Documentation**: Detailed comments explaining the addition logic
- **Multiple Examples**: Various use cases including positive, negative, and zero values
- **Formatted Output**: Shows input values and results clearly

## Code Structure

The `main.go` file now contains:

1. **Package Declaration**: `package main` - defines this as an executable program
2. **Import Statement**: Imports the `fmt` package for formatted I/O operations
3. **Main Function**: Orchestrates all three features in sequence
4. **Hello World Function**: `printHelloWorld()` with step-by-step comments
5. **Server Message Function**: `printServerMessage()` showing server information
6. **Addition Demo Function**: `demonstrateAddition()` showcasing the math function
7. **Addition Function**: `addNumbers(a int, b int) int` with detailed documentation

### Function Details

**addNumbers Function Signature:**
```go
func addNumbers(a int, b int) int
```

**Parameters:**
- `a int`: The first integer to add
- `b int`: The second integer to add

**Returns:**
- `int`: The sum of the two input integers

**Addition Logic Explanation:**
The function uses Go's built-in `+` operator to perform mathematical addition on the two integer parameters. The operator takes the numeric values of `a` and `b`, performs the addition operation, and returns the result as an integer.

## Command-Line Instructions

### Method 1: Direct Run (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Go-prompt-exercise

# Run the program directly (compiles and runs in one step)
go run main.go
```

### Method 2: Compile Then Execute
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Go-prompt-exercise

# Compile the program (creates an executable named 'all-features-demo')
go build -o all-features-demo main.go

# Run the compiled executable
./all-features-demo
```

### Method 3: Default Build Name
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Go-prompt-exercise

# Compile with default executable name (go-prompt-exercise)
go build

# Run the compiled executable
./go-prompt-exercise
```

## Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see all three features demonstrated:

```
=== Go Prompt Exercise - All Features ===

1. Hello World Feature:
Hello, World!
This is printed using fmt.Print (no automatic newline)
Using fmt.Printf with variable: Hello, World!

2. Server Feature:
Starting server on :8080...
Server would be running at: http://localhost:8080
Available endpoints would be:
  - GET / (Welcome message)
  - GET /health (Health check)
Note: Server is not actually started in this demo

3. Addition Function Feature:
First number: 15
Second number: 25
Sum: 15 + 25 = 40

Additional examples:
10 + 5 = 15
100 + 200 = 300
-5 + 15 = 10
0 + 42 = 42
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later installed on your system
- No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

## Learning Objectives

This comprehensive project demonstrates:
- **Program Organization**: How to structure a program with multiple features
- **Function Definition**: Creating functions with parameters and return values
- **Console Output**: Multiple methods of printing to the console
- **Mathematical Operations**: Integer arithmetic and the addition operator
- **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive commenting and function documentation
- **Project Evolution**: How code can evolve to incorporate multiple requirements

## Function Usage Examples

You can modify the `demonstrateAddition()` function to test different values:

```go
// Test your own values
result1 := addNumbers(50, 30)     // Returns 80
result2 := addNumbers(-10, 5)     // Returns -5
result3 := addNumbers(0, 100)     // Returns 100
```
